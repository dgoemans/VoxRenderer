# VoxRenderer
A renderer for the .vox file format as generated by MagicaVoxel.

Note that the library `parse-magica-voxel` that's included doesn't support MagicaVoxel 0.99 vox files.

I forked the library here: 
https://github.com/dgoemans/parse-magica-voxel
and added support for unknown chunks. I sent a PR to the original lib, but it's not updated yet. I used `npm link` to run it locally.
